# Natural-Language-Processing 
    The purpose of this project is to look at customer complaints trends and investigate what topics are being discussed using topic modeling. Specifically, we will use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is a widely used topic modelling technique. This project is broken up into 2 parts. Part 1 focuses on EDA and visualization of the data, and Part 2 goes into LDA Topic Modeling using the Gensim library.
